# EXP.NO.4-IMPLEMENTATION-OF-LINE-CODEING-TECHNIQUES

4.Implementation of Line Codeing Techniques 
  
## AIM:

 The objective of this experiment is to study the Line coding techniques using the trainer kit.
 
## APPARATUS REQUIRED:

Trainer Kit, DSO(10MHz) , Patch Cords and Power Supply (0-30V) 

## PROCEDURE:

1.Connect power supply in proper polarity to the kits DCL-05 and DCL-06 and switch iton.

2.Connect CLOCK and DATA generated on DCL-05 to CODING CLOCK IN and DATA INPUT respectively by means of the patch-chords provided.

3.Connect the coded data NRZ-L on DCL-05 to the corresponding DATA INPUTNRZL, of the decoding logic on DCL-06.

4.Keep the switch SW2 for NRZ-L to ON position for decoding logic as shown in theblock diagram.

5.Observe the coded and decoded signal on the oscilloscope.

6.Connect the coded data NRZ-M on DCL-05 to the corresponding DATA INPUTNRZM, of the decoding logic on DCL-06.

7.Keep the switch SW2 for NRZ â€“M to ON position for decoding logic as shown in theblock diagram.
